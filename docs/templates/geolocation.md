### **OSINT Challenge Template**

**Challenge Title:** Find \[Target's Name/Event\]'s Location and Time

**Objective:** Use Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques to determine the exact geographic location and the specific time window when the provided image was captured.

**Source Material:** \[Insert Link to High-Resolution Photograph Here\]

#### **Required Output**

| Category               | Detail                                                                            |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1\. Geolocation**    | Specific location name (e.g., city, site, structure) and approximate coordinates. |
| **2\. Chronolocation** | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) and a narrow time window (e.g., HH:MM AM to HH:MM AM/PM).       |

#### **Methodology (Key Steps)**

1. **Contextual Search (Reverse Image Search):**
   - Find the image online to gather initial context, potential date, and event details from news or social media.
2. **Geolocation (Landmark Matching):**
   - Identify unique background features (mountains, buildings, roads, vegetation).
   - Use satellite mapping tools (e.g., Google Earth/Maps) to match these features and pinpoint the exact position.
3. **Chronolocation (Shadow Analysis):**
   - Use the confirmed date and location coordinates with a shadow calculator (e.g., SunCalc).
   - Adjust the time until the direction and length of the shadows in the calculator match those seen in the source photograph.
