## Note-Taking Best Practices

### Structure and Organization

1. **Use Consistent Naming Conventions**
   - Date-based filing (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Subject-based categorization
   - Unique case identifiers

2. **Create Information Hierarchies**
   - Main investigation folder
   - Subject-specific subfolders
   - Evidence categories (images, documents, profiles)

3. **Implement Tagging Systems**
   - Use relevant keywords
   - Create tag taxonomies
   - Enable cross-reference capabilities

### Documentation Standards

#### Source Attribution
Always record:
- URL and timestamp
- Screenshot date and time
- Tool or method used for collection
- Confidence level of information

#### Evidence Preservation
- Maintain original file formats
- Create backup copies
- Document chain of custody
- Use hash values for integrity verification

### Information Verification

#### Cross-Reference Methods
- Multiple source confirmation
- Timeline consistency checks
- Fact-checking against known data
- Reverse verification techniques

#### Confidence Levels
Use standardized confidence indicators:
- **High**: Multiple independent sources confirm
- **Medium**: Single reliable source or multiple unconfirmed sources
- **Low**: Unverified single source
- **Uncertain**: Conflicting information exists

## Sock Puppets and Operational Security

### Creating Research Personas

Sock puppets are fictional online personas used for intelligence gathering without revealing your real identity.

#### Key Resources:
- [Creating Effective Sock Puppets](https://notes.z3r0r3z.com/osint/sock_puppets/jake_creps_sock_puppet/)
- [The Art Of The Sock](https://www.secjuice.com/the-art-of-the-sock-osint-humint/)
- [Anonymous Sockpuppet Account Setup Process](https://www.reddit.com/r/OSINT/comments/dp70jr/my_process_for_setting_up_anonymous_sockpuppet/)

#### Example Persona Elements:
- Email: `louisthornton@jourrapide.com`
- Consistent backstory and interests
- Appropriate profile photos
- Realistic activity patterns

#### Platform-Specific Considerations:
- **Twitter**: Focus on interests and engagement patterns
- **LinkedIn**: Professional background and connections
- **Facebook**: Personal interests and social connections

### Security Measures

1. **Compartmentalization**
   - Separate devices or virtual machines
   - Different browsers with cleared data
   - Unique personas for different investigations

2. **Anonymous Communication**
   - VPN services
   - Tor browser
   - Temporary email services
   - Encrypted messaging

3. **Evidence Protection**
   - Encrypted storage
   - Secure backup procedures
   - Access control measures
   - Regular security audits

## Documentation Templates

### Investigation Log Template
```
Case ID: [Unique Identifier]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Investigator: [Name/ID]
Objective: [Investigation goals]

Timeline:
- [Timestamp]: [Action taken]
- [Timestamp]: [Information discovered]
- [Timestamp]: [Verification completed]

Sources:
- [Source 1]: [Description and reliability]
