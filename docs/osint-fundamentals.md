# OSINT Fundamentals

## What is OSINT?

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) involves collecting and analyzing information that is publicly available for research purposes. This intelligence gathering technique uses open sources to obtain actionable information from various platforms and databases.

## Core Principles

### Information Sources

OSINT utilizes publicly available information from:

- **Social Media Platforms**: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok
- **Search Engines**: Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Baidu, DuckDuckGo
- **Public Databases**: Government records, academic publications, news archives
- **Web Archives**: Wayback Machine, cached pages
- **Professional Networks**: Company websites, employee directories
- **Forums and Communities**: Reddit, specialized forums, Q&A sites

### Key Methodologies

1. **Passive Collection**: Gathering information without direct interaction
2. **Active Collection**: Engaging with sources while maintaining operational security
3. **Cross-Verification**: Confirming information through multiple sources
4. **Timeline Analysis**: Understanding chronological relationships
5. **Network Mapping**: Identifying connections between entities

## Ethical Considerations

### Legal Compliance

- Always respect local and international laws
- Understand privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Comply with platform terms of service
- Respect copyright and intellectual property rights

### Ethical Guidelines

- Obtain proper authorization for investigations
- Protect privacy of uninvolved individuals
- Use information responsibly
- Maintain confidentiality when required
- Document sources and methods transparently

## OSINT Workflow

### 1. Planning and Requirements

- Define investigation objectives
- Identify information requirements
- Establish legal and ethical boundaries
- Create data collection plan

### 2. Collection

- Use appropriate tools and techniques
- Maintain detailed documentation
- Preserve evidence integrity
- Follow chain of custody procedures

### 3. Processing and Analysis

- Organize collected information
- Verify source reliability
- Identify patterns and connections
- Create visual representations (timelines, network maps)

### 4. Dissemination

- Present findings clearly
- Include source citations
- Highlight confidence levels
- Provide actionable intelligence

## Security Considerations

### Operational Security (OPSEC)

- Use VPNs and Tor for anonymity
- Create separate research personas
- Avoid leaving digital footprints
- Monitor for counter-surveillance

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive information
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits

## Common OSINT Applications
