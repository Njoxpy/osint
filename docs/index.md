# OSINT Learning Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) learning guide. This documentation provides essential tools, techniques, and methodologies for conducting effective OSINT investigations.

## What is OSINT?

OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) involves collecting and analyzing information that is publicly available for research purposes. This intelligence gathering technique uses open sources to obtain actionable information from various platforms including:

- Social media platforms
- Public databases
- Search engines
- Government websites
- News sources
- Academic publications

## Key Features of This Guide
