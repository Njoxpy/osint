# Identifying birthdates

## Purpose
Methods and practical search queries to locate a subject's date of birth using publicly available information. Emphasize verification and legal/ethical constraints.

## Direct search (text-based)
- Google query patterns:
  - "Full Name" birthday
  - "Full Name" intext:birthday
  - "Full Name" intext:"happy birthday"
  - "Full Name" "born" OR "born on" OR "DOB"
- Site-specific queries:
  - site:twitter.com "Full Name" "happy birthday"
  - site:facebook.com "Full Name" birthday
  - site:linkedin.com "Full Name" OR "Full Name" site:linkedin.com
- Try variations: nicknames, initials, common misspellings, year-only searches (e.g., "1990" + "Full Name").

## Resumes, profiles and public records
- Search for resume/CV and profile pages:
  - "Full Name resume" OR "Full Name CV"
  - site:linkedin.com "Full Name"
  - site:gov OR site:edu OR site: alumni directories
- Public records and archives (where lawful): obituaries, alumni lists, professional bios—these sometimes include birth years or full dates.

## Image-based clues and geolocation
- Reverse-image search profile photos, event photos, or posted images to find other copies with captions or dates.
- Inspect images for contextual clues:
  - License plates, road signs, shop names, language, architectural styles, vegetation, clothing for seasonal context.
  - Visible house numbers, street signs, or business names to search local records or maps.
- Check image metadata (EXIF) when available, but expect most social platforms to strip metadata.

## Platform-specific: TikTok and short-form video sites
- Search for birthday-related content: captions, comments, hashtags (#birthday, #turning25, etc.).
- Check pinned posts, video descriptions, and live-stream timestamps for mentions of age or date.
- Extract thumbnails or still frames and run reverse-image searches.

## Verification and documentation
- Corroborate any found date with at least two independent, public sources.
- Record the source, URL, and capture timestamp for each claim.
- Prefer official or self-published sources (e.g., personal website, verified social account) over third-party mentions.

## Practical query examples
- "Full Name" intext:"happy birthday" site:twitter.com
- "Full Name" "born" site:edu
- "Full Name" resume OR "Full Name" CV
- "Street Name" "city" + "Full Name" (when an address clue exists)

## Ethical and legal considerations
- Use only information that is publicly available and permissible under local law.
- Avoid doxxing, harassment, or attempts to access private data.
- If a birthdate is sensitive, consider whether it is necessary to collect or disclose it.

## Tips
- Use multiple spelling and language variants.
- Search archived pages (Wayback Machine) for removed content.
- Combine textual and image-based methods for stronger verification.
